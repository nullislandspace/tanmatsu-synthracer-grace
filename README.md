## Race The Synth

Tanmatsu game "Race The Synth".

This uses [Graceloader](https://github.com/nullislandspace/tanmatsu-graceloader) as a launcher.

Built on **SynthEngine3D**, a reusable engine extracted from this game (run
loop, software 3D renderer, audio mixer + procedural music, menus, input
bindings, save framework). It now lives in its own repository,
[nullislandspace/synthengine3D](https://github.com/nullislandspace/synthengine3D),
and is consumed here as a git submodule at [`synthengine3D/`](synthengine3D/) --
a dual-mode IDF / plain-CMake component with its own docs; the game itself is
the content + rules in [`main/`](main/).

Clone with submodules, or the build will fail with a missing `synthengine3D/`:

```sh
git clone --recursive git@github.com:nullislandspace/tanmatsu-synthracer-grace.git
# or, in an existing clone:
git submodule update --init
```

## 3D: SynthEngine3D

[SynthEngine3D](https://github.com/nullislandspace/synthengine3D) is the 3D engine for
graceloader apps: a software rasteriser (z-buffer and raycast), PPA compositing, meshes,
textures, lighting, audio and UI helpers, with its own `se_run()` main loop.

The engine is **not** shipped with the template, so apps that do not want it are not
carrying it around. What the template does ship is the build wiring, which sits idle until
an app adds the engine. In a new app that wants 3D:

```sh
make engine     # git submodule add -b main git@github.com:nullislandspace/synthengine3D.git synthengine3D
git add .gitmodules synthengine3D && git commit -m "Add SynthEngine3D"
```

`CMakeLists.txt` picks it up by itself: when `synthengine3D/CMakeLists.txt` exists it builds
the engine, propagates its include directory (so app sources can `#include "synthengine3d.h"`)
and folds its objects into `app.so`. When it does not, the link line is exactly the plain
one, which is why every app can keep this template as `upstream` whether it uses 3D or not.

Two things follow from it being a submodule:

* clone such an app with `git clone --recursive`, or run `git submodule update --init` in it;
* `git submodule update --remote synthengine3D` moves it to the newest engine, and an app
  that wants a fixed version pins it (`ENGINE_REF=V2.0 make engine`, or check out the tag
  inside `synthengine3D/` and commit the new pointer).

Engine settings (list caps and the like) are compile definitions that must reach the
`synthengine3d` target, so set them with `add_compile_definitions()` **before**
`add_subdirectory(synthengine3D)` — see the engine's `docs/configuration.md`.
