// Software audio mixer owning the BSP's single I2S channel.
//
// Two kinds of source: one music slot (typically a procedural
// generator today; future modplayer / MP3 / MIDI sources will
// plug into the same slot) and N SFX voices for short-lived
// effects (engine hum, ding, crash, scrape, cube-bump, …).
//
// Pipeline format: 22050 Hz, signed-16-bit PCM, stereo L/R
// interleaved. See `audio_source.h` for the source contract.
//
// Idle power management: when the music slot is NULL and every
// SFX voice is finished, the mixer keeps feeding silence to the
// I2S DMA queue for a short drain window (~46 ms), then mutes
// the speaker amplifier and disables the I2S channel; it blocks
// until a producer pokes it via `audio_mixer_set_music()` or
// `audio_mixer_register_voice()`.
